My dotfiles
===================

These are forked from thoughtbot dotfiles. Intended for my personal use but feel free to fork if you find them useful. I made a point not to add any personal or not reusable stuff except in hosts and tags but anything could happen.

Requirements
------------

Unlike the original thoughtbot dotfiles, these are optimized for bash and neovim. zsh and anything ruby-related was purged.

You still need rcm, of course, it's by far the best tool for this.

Install
-------

Clone and `rcup`.

Make your own customizations
----------------------------

Not all of these will work, but I'm working on it:

* `~/.aliases.local`
* `~/.config/git/local`
* `~/.tmux.conf.local`
* `~/.config/nvim/local.vim`
* `~/.config/nvim/plugins.local.vim`
* `~/.bashrc.local`


What's in it?
-------------

It's quite different from the original, I'll describe it later.
